# Base
**Minimal CSS framework optimised for web performance**


The smallest CSS framework to add to your project. 
I use it in all of my projects, including my [WordPress themes](https://themeforest.net/user/darinka?ref=Darinka).

[Demo](http://designagent.sk/base/)

## It includes:
* Eric Meyer's [browser reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2011/01/03/reset-revisited/)
* Usage of [System fonts](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/using-system-ui-fonts-practical-guide/)
* [8pt system](https://medium.com/built-to-adapt/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632#.5z3n0fc3v) for margins and paddings
* Basic typography flow
* Basic styling for all elements
* Basic responsive columns
* CSS classes for alignments and font sizes (e.g. .alignleft or .size-xxl)
* Basic WordPress-specific styling for image captions and calendar widget at the end (feel free to delete if not using WordPress). This is needed for passing the theme review.

## Use it
I usually add it directly to top of my style.css to save a HTTP call. Or import:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="base.css" media="all" />  
```

## Licence
Just use it.

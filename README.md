# Base
## Minimal CSS framework optimised for web performance

The smallest CSS framework to add to your project. I use it in all of my projects, including my [WordPress themes](https://themeforest.net/user/darinka?ref=Darinka).

## It uses:
* Eric Meyer's [browser reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2011/01/03/reset-revisited/)
* [System fonts](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/using-system-ui-fonts-practical-guide/)
* [8pt system](https://medium.com/built-to-adapt/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632#.5z3n0fc3v) for margins and paddings
* Basic typography flow
* Basic styling for all elements
* Basic responsive columns

## Include it
I usually add it directly to top of my style.css to save a HTTP call.
